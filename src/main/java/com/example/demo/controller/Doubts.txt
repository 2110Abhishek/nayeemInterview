### 1. **`@RestController`**

#### What is `@RestController`?
- `@RestController` is a special type of Spring annotation that is used to define a controller in a Spring Boot application.
- It tells Spring that this class is going to handle HTTP requests and send HTTP responses.
- A controller typically responds to web requests by returning data. Instead of returning an HTML page, it will return JSON or XML data (which is useful for REST APIs).
  
#### How it works:
- When a request is sent to a specific URL, Spring will look for a class annotated with `@RestController` and match the request to a method in that class.
- The `@RestController` combines two annotations: `@Controller` (which indicates that this class is a controller) and `@ResponseBody` (which means the return value of the method will be directly written into the HTTP response body as JSON or XML).

#### Why it is used:
- It simplifies writing APIs because you don’t have to manually convert your objects to JSON (Spring Boot handles it for you).
  
**Example:** When you send a request to `/api/users`, the `UserController` will be responsible for handling that request and sending back a response, such as a JSON object representing a user.

### 2. **`@Autowired`**

#### What is `@Autowired`?
- `@Autowired` is a Spring annotation used for **dependency injection**.
  
#### Why it is used:
- It automatically injects (provides) the required object (like `userService` here) into the class, without needing to create it manually.
- This saves you from writing boilerplate code like `UserService userService = new UserService();`.

#### How it works:
- Spring has a **container** (a special system that manages all your objects or beans). When it sees `@Autowired`, it will automatically find the object (`UserService` in this case) and "inject" it into the `UserController`.
  
#### Example:
- Instead of writing `new UserService()` every time you need it, you declare it with `@Autowired`, and Spring takes care of the rest, ensuring there’s always an instance of `UserService` available in `UserController`.

### 3. **`ResponseEntity<User>`**

#### What is `ResponseEntity<User>`?
- `ResponseEntity` is a Spring class that represents the whole HTTP response.
- It allows you to set not just the body of the response (like the user data) but also the status code (like 200 OK or 404 Not Found) and headers.

#### Why it is used:
- It gives more control over the HTTP response. You can set the exact response status and body.

#### How it works:
- `<User>` here specifies the type of data that the body of the response will hold. In this case, the body will contain a `User` object, which will be serialized into JSON and returned in the HTTP response.

#### Example:
- If the user is created successfully, you return a `ResponseEntity<User>` where `User` is the body and 200 OK is the status. This allows the frontend or API consumer to know exactly what happened with the request.

### 4. **`@RequestBody Map<String, String> userData`**

#### What is `@RequestBody`?
- `@RequestBody` is an annotation used to indicate that the method parameter should be bound to the body of the HTTP request.
  
#### Why it is used:
- It allows you to receive complex data (like JSON) sent in the request body and automatically convert it into a Java object or data structure.

#### How it works:
- In this case, the data sent in the HTTP POST request (likely in JSON format) will be mapped to the `Map<String, String> userData` parameter.
- For example, if you send `{"email": "test@example.com"}` in the request body, Spring will automatically convert this into a map where `"email"` is the key and `"test@example.com"` is the value.

#### Example:
- The frontend sends a JSON object `{ "email": "john@example.com" }` to the server. Spring will map this JSON object to the `userData` map, so when you call `userData.get("email")`, it will return `"john@example.com"`.

### Recap:
- `@RestController`: A class annotation that makes the class handle HTTP requests and return data as JSON.
- `@Autowired`: Automatically injects dependencies (like `userService`) into the class, saving the need to manually create instances.
- `ResponseEntity<User>`: A way to send back both the HTTP response status and the user object in the response body.
- `@RequestBody`: Automatically binds the incoming request body to a method parameter, like a map or object.
